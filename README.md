## My first website! Milestoje project 1 by André Bergan
# PROJECT PURPOSE
This website presents my work for the first milestone project. 
This is my very first project I have done after starting to learn about software development. 
This website is a description/autobiography of myself and demonstrates my ability in HTML5 and CSS3. It also includes
a brief description of me as a person and about my future plans.


# UX

Navigating to different sections of the page is made possible by the navigation bar, which is set at the top of the page. It also collapses on smaller screens to take up less space and make for a better user experience.
Potential employers can quickly navigate through the navigation bar to get to the section they wish to learn about me from. 
In the image section, you can view a handful of pictures of me throughout the last few years.
The carousel includes a "hire me" button that links to the "contact me" section so that it is easier for the reader to navigate.
Included a "logo picture" of me in the navigation bar so that the user can see a representation of myself at the beginning as well as adding style to the page.
It also shows a visual representation of my ability with HTML5 and CSS
